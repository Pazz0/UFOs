# UFOs

A truly out of this world dynamic data experience!

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that hosts a dynamic table that displays UFO data. Using this website we were able develop further and provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Using Javascript we created table filters to be able to narrow down date, city, state, country, and shape for UFO sighting data.

## Results

We were able to showcase all the data for UFO sightings on our website including a Filter Search option to be able to narrow down when and where our UFO encounters took place.

Our search feature comes equipped with multiple entries to really narrow down search criteria. There are placeholders with examples of each criterias formatting. To use this table is simple! Let's say we want to search for UFO encounters in the state of Florida. Simply type "fl" into the State filter and press the "Enter" key on your keyboard:

THe results will now show all the encounters that went down in the Sunshine State!

All tht other citeria work the same way. Type your desired outcome into the appropriate filter and press enter on your keyboard.

## Summary
 
The table was an overall success and works functionally to provide the client with their desired search preferences.

### Setbacks and Future Development

One big drawback of this webpage is that it loads the complete table in the beginning. This is a large uneeded amount of data that should be better presented.

We will adress two additional recommendations for further development on the project. First we would consider creating a more appealing table by only displaying the wanted data after being filtered by at least one filter. The second recommendation would be to create more filters, such as "Duration", to be able to further narrow down even more close encounters with our Alien freinds.
